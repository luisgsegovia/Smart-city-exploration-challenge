## Implementation of additional analytics tools
In a future cycle of the app, additional analytics tools can be integrated, such as **Firebase Analytics** to capture these metrics. Such as:

* Using dashboards and reports inside the platform to track metrics
* Interpret regularly trhese metrics to check app health and engagement, identifying areas for improvement.
